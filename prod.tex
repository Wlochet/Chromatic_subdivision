\section{Definitions and preliminaries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


We denote by $[k]$ the set of integers $\{1, \dots , k\}$.

Let $F$ be a digraph.
A digraph $D$ is said to be {\it $F$-subdivision-free}, if it contains no subdivision of $F$.

The {\it union} of two digraphs $D_1$ and $D_2$ is the digraph  $D_1\cup D_2$ defined by $V(D_1\cup D_2) = V(D_1)\cup V(D_2)$ and 
$A(D_1\cup D_2) = A(D_1)\cup A(D_2)$.
If ${\cal D}$ is a set of digraphs, we denote by $\bigcup {\cal D}$ the union of the digraphs, i.e. $V(\bigcup {\cal D}) =\bigcup_{D\in {\cal D}} V(D)$
and $A(\bigcup {\cal D}) =\bigcup_{D\in {\cal D}} A(D)$.



{\bf def de dipath}

Let $P$ be a path. We denote by $s(P)$ its initial vertex and by $t(P)$ its terminal vertex.
The subpath of $P$ with initial vertex $u$ and terminal vertex $v$ is denoted by $P[u,v]$.
Similarly, if $C$ is a directed cycle, we denote by $C[u,v]$ the subdipath of $C$ with initial vertex $u$ and terminal vertex $v$.


Let $k_1,k_2,k_3$ be positive integers. Let $P(k_1,k_2;k_3)$ be the digraph formed by three internally disjoint paths between two vertices $x,y$, two $(x,y)$-dipaths, one of size at least $k_1$, the other of size at least $k_2$, and one $(y,x)$-dipath of size at least $k_3$.
When we want to insist on the vertices $x$ and $y$, we denote it by $P_{xy}(k_1,k_2;k_3)$.


The {\it connected components} of a digraph are the connected components of its underlying graph.

Let $c$ be a colouring of a graph $G$. A subset of vertices or a subgraph $S$ of $G$ is {\it rainbow-coloured} if all vertices of $S$ have distinct colours.


A (directed) graph $G$ is {\it $k$-degenerate} if every subgraph $H$ of $G$ has a vertex of degree at most $k$.
The following proposition is well-known.
\begin{proposition}[useful??]\label{prop:deg}
Every $k$-degenerate (directed) graph is $(k+1)$-colourable.
\end{proposition}





We will need the following lemmas:

\begin{lemma}[useful??]\label{walk}
Let $D$ be a digraph and $W$ a walk of length $t^l$ such that every vertex appears at most $t$ times.
Then there exists a dipath of length $l$ starting with the first vertex of $W$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We do it by induction on $l$. Let $x$ be the first vertex of $W$, because $x$ appears at most $t$ times, there exists a subpath of length greater
than $t^l/t$ not containing $x$. If we apply induction to the longest of such path, then we find a path of length $l-1$ without $x$ such that
 the first vertex is an out-neighbour of $x$.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{min}
Let $\sigma=(u_t)_{t\in [p]}$ be a sequence of integers in $[k]$. If $p\geq l^k$, then there exists a set $L$ of $l$ indices such that for any $i,j \in L$ with $i < j$ the following holds : $u_i=u_j$ and $u_k > u_i$, for all $i < k < j$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction on $k$, the result holding trivially when $k=1$. Assume now that $k>1$. Let $L_1$ be the elements of the sequence with value $1$. If $L_1$ has at least $l$ elements, we are done.
If not then there is a subsequence $\sigma'$ of $l^k/l$ consecutive elements in $\{2, \dots , k-1\}$. Applying the induction hypothesis to $\sigma'$ yields the result.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{max}
Let $\sigma=(u_t)_{t\in [p]}$ be a sequence of integers in $[k]$. 
If $p > k (m-1)$, then there exists a subsequence of $m$ consecutive integers such that the
last one is the largest.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction on $k$, the result holding trivially when $k=1$. 
Let $i$ be the smallest integer such that $u_t\leq k-1$ for all $i\leq t\leq p$.
If $i>m$, then $u_{i-1}=k$, and the subsequence of the $i-1$ first elements of $\sigma$ is the desired sequence.
If $i\leq m$, apply the induction on $\sigma'=(u_t)_{i\leq t\leq p}$ which is a sequence of more than $(k-1)(m-1)$ integers in $[k-1]$, to get the result. 
\end{proof}











\section{$P(k,1;k)$}
%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{theorem}
Let $D$ be a strongly connected digraph. If $\chi(D) > \cste$, then $D$ contains a subdvision of $P(k,1;k)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We prove the result by the contrapositive. We consider a digraph $D$ that contains no subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$.
We shall prove that $\chi(D) \leq \cste$.

\subsection{Suitable collections of directed cycles}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


A collection ${\cal C}$ of directed cycles is {\it suitable} if all cycles of ${\cal C}$ have length at least $12k$, and for
any two distinct cycles $C_i,C_j\in\mathcal C$ intersect on  subpath $P_{i,j}$ of order at most $k$.
We denote by $s_{i,j}$ (resp. $t_{i,j}$) the initial (resp. terminal) vertex of  $P_{i,j}$.
 
 
 
 
 
 \begin{lemma}\label{lem:dis}
 Let ${\cal C}$ be a suitable collection of directed cycles in a $P(k,1;k)$-\free\ digraph.
Let $C_1,C_2,C_3\in\mathcal C$ pairwise intersect, and let $v$ belong to $V(C_2)\cap V(C_3)\setminus V(C_1)$. Then exactly one of the following holds:
\begin{itemize}
\item $C_2[t_{1,2}, v]$ and $C_3[t_{1,3}, v]$ have both length at most $4k$; 
\item $C_2[v, s_{1,2}]$ and $C_3[v, s_{1,3}]$ have both length at most $4k$.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose it is not the case. By symmetry, we may assume that $C_3[t_{1,3},v]$ has length at most $4k$ and
$C_2[v, s_{1,2}]$ has length at most $4k$, so  $C_2[t_{1,2},v]$ has length greater than $4k$.

Observe that $t_{2,3}\notin V(C_1)$ for otherwise $C_3[v,t_{1,3}]$ has length less than $2k$ (since it is contained in $P_{2,3}\cup P_{1,3}$ and each of those paths has length at most $k-1$ by definition of ${\cal C}$) and so $C_3[t_{1,3},v]$ has length at least $10k$, a contradiction.
We distinguish two cases according to the position of $s_{1,3}$ in $C_1$ relatively to $s_{1,2}$ and $t_{1,2}$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Assume $s_{1,3}\in C_1[s_{1,2},t_{1,2}]$. The dipath  $C_3[s_1,3,t_{2,3}]$ is contained in $P_{1,2}\cup P_{2,3}$ and has lentgh less than $2k$. So $C_3[t_{2,3}, s_{1,3}]$ has length at least $k$. Moreover, $C_1[s_{1,3}, t_{1,2}]\odot C_2[t_{1,2}, t_{2,3}]$ contains $C_1[t_{1,2}, v]$  and so has legth at least $4k$. Consequently, the union of $C_1[s_{1,3}, t_{1,2}]\odot C_2[t_{1,2}, t_{2,3}]$, $C_3[t_{2,3}, s_{1,3}]$, and
$C_2[t_{2,3}, s_{1,2}]\odot C_1[s_{1,2}, s_{1,3}]$ is a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.

	\item Assume now that $s_{1,3}\in C_1[t_{1,2},s_{1,2}]$. The dipath  $C_2[s_{1,2}, t_{2,3}]$ has length greater than $4k$ because it contains $C_2[t_{1,2},v]$. Moreover, the dipath $C_3[s_{1,3}, t_{2,3}]$ is contained in $P_{1,3}\cup C_3[t_{1,3},v]$, and so has length at most $5k$.
	Thus $C_3[t_2,3, s_{1,3}]$ has length at least $7k$.
	 Consequently, the union of $C_2[s_{1,2}, t_{2,3}]$, $C_3[t_2,3, s_{1,3}]\odot C_1[s_{1,3}, s_{1,2}]$, and $C_2[t_{2,3}, s_{1,2}]$ is a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
 
 
 
 
 
 
% Let $D[\mathcal{C}]$ be the graph induced on $D$ by the vertices in $\mathcal{C}$ and let $D'$ be the subdigraph of $D[\mathcal{C}]$ with vertex set $V(D)$ and arc set  $\bigcup_{C\in {\cal C}} A(C)$.

Let ${\cal C}$ be a suitable collection of directed cycles.
For every set of vertices or digraph $S$, we denote by ${\cal C}\cap S$ the set of cycles of ${\cal C}$ that intersect $S$. 



Let $C_1\in \mathcal{C}$.
For each $C_j\in {\cal C} \cap C_1$, let $Q_j$ be the subdipath of $C_j$ such that
containing all the vertices that are at distance at most $4k$ from $P_{1,j}$ in the cycle underlying $C_j$.
Then the dipath $C_j[s(Q_j), s_{1,j}]$ and  $C_j[t_{1,j},t (Q_j)]$ have length $4k$.
Set $Q^-_j=C[s(Q_j), s_{1,j}[$ and $Q^+_j=C]t_{1,j}, t(Q_j)]$.


Set $I^+(C_1) = \bigcup_{C_j\in {\cal C}\cap C_1} Q^+_j$ and $I^-(C_1) = \bigcup_{C_j\in {\cal C}\cap C_1} Q^-_j$.
Observe that Lemma~\ref{lem:dis} implies that $I^+(C_1)$ and $I^-(C_1)$ are vertex-disjoint digraphs. We set $I(C_1)=I^+(C_1)\cup I^-(C_1)$.




\begin{lemma}\label{lem:A}
Let ${\cal C}$ be a suitable collection of directed cycles in a $P(k,1;k)$-\free\ digraph.
Let $C_1$ be a cycle of ${\cal C}$ and let $A$ be a connected component of $\bigcup{\cal C} - I(C_1)$.
All vertices of $({\cal C}\cap A)  - A$ belongs to a unique cycle $C_A$ of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose it is not the case. Then there are two distinct cycles $C_2, C_3$ of ${\cal C}\cap A$ that intersect with $C_1$.

Let $t$ be the closest vertex among $\{t_{1,2}, t_{1,3}\}$ in $C_1$ and let $t'$ be the other vertex of $\{t_{1,2}, t_{1,3}\}$.
(If $t_{1,2}=t_{1,3}$, then $t=t'$.) For $i=2,3$, let $R_i$ be the $(t,t(Q_i)$-dipath in $C_1\cup Q_i$. Observe that $R_i=Q_i$ or $R_i=C_1[t,t']\cup Q_I$. Hence $R_i$ has length at least $4k$.
Let $v$ be the last vertex in $R_2\cap R_3$ along $R_2$. (This vertex exists since $t\in R_2\cap R_3$.) In $A$, there exists a $(t(Q_3), C_2)$-dipath $R_A$. Let $w$ be its terminal vertex. By definition of $A$, $w$ is in $C_2[t(Q_2, s(Q_2)]$, therefore $C_2[w,v]$ has length at least $4k$ since it contains $C_2[s(Q_2), s_{1,2}]$. Consequently, both $R_2[v,t(Q_2)]$ and $R_3[v,t(Q_3)]$ have length less than $k$ for otherwise the union of $C_2[w,v]$, $C_2[v,w]$ and $R_3[v,t(Q_3)]\odot R_A$ would be a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$.
In particular, $v\neq t$. This implies that $s_{2,3}\in V(R_2\cap R_3)$.
Moreover, $R_2[s_{2,3}, t(Q_2)]$ has length at most $2k$ because $R_2[s_{2,3},v]$ is a subdipath of $P_{2,3}$ and so has length at most $k$.
Therefore $R_2[t,s_{2,3}]$ has length at least $2k$ because $R_2$ has length at least $4k$.
It follows that the union of $C_2[s_{2,3},t]$,  $R_2[t,s_{2,3}]$ and  $R_3[t,s_{2,3}]$ is a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}




\begin{lemma}\label{lem:no-dicycle}
Let ${\cal C}$ be a suitable collection of directed cycles in a $P(k,1;k)$-\free\ digraph. For any cycle $C_1\in {\cal C}$, the digraph
$I^+(C_1)$ has no directed cycle.  
\end{lemma}
\begin{subproof}
Suppose for a contradiction that $I^+(C_1)$  contains a directed cycle $C'$.
Clearly, it must contain arcs from at least two $Q^+_j$.



Assume that $C'$ contains several vertices of $Q^+_j$.
Necessarily, there must be two vertices $x,y$ of $Q^+_j\cap C'$ such that no vertex of $C']x,y[$ is in $C_j$ and  $y$ is before $x$ in $Q^+_j$.
Therefore $C'[x,y]\odot Q^+[y,x]$ is also a directed cycle in $I^+(C_1)$. Free to consider this cycle,
we may assume that $C'\cap Q^+_j$ is a directed path.

Doing so, for all $j$, we may assume that $C'\cap Q^+_j$ is a directed path  for every $C_j\in {\cal C}\cap C_1$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that there are cycles $C_2, \dots , C_p$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $C'$ is in $Q^+_2\cup \cdots  \cup Q^+_p$;
\item for all $2\leq j\leq p$, $C'\cap Q^+_j$ is a directed path $P^+_j$ with initial vertex $a_j$ and terminal vertex $b_j$;
\item the $a_j$ and the $b_j$ appear according to the following order around $C'$: $(a_2, b_p, a_3, b_2, \dots ,   a_p, b_{p-1}, a_2)$ with possibly $a_{j+1}=b_j$ for some $1\leq j \leq p$ where $a_{p+1}=a_2$.
\end{itemize}
For $2\leq j\leq p$, set $B_j=C_j[b_j, a_j]$. Note that $B_j$ has length at least $7k$, because $Q^+_2$ has length at most $5k$.


Consider the closed directed walk $$W=C_p[a_2,b_p]\odot B_p \odot C_{p-1}[a_p, b_{p-1}] \odot  \cdots  \odot  B_3\odot C_2[a_3, b_2]\odot B_2.$$
$W$ contains a directed cycle $C_W$. Wihtout loss of generality, we may assume that this cycle is of the form
$$C_W=B_q[v, a_q] \odot C_{q-1}[a_q, b_{q-1}] \odot  \cdots  \odot  B_3\odot C_2[a_3, b_2]\odot B_2[b_2, v]$$
for some vertex $v\in B_2\cap B_r$. (The case when $W$ is a directed cycle corresponds to $q=p+1$ and $B_2=B_{p+1}$.)

Note that necessarily, $q\geq 4$, for $B_3$ does not intersect $B_2$, for otherwise $b_3=b_2$ since the intersection of $C_2$ and $C_3$ is a dipath.

Observe that $C_W[b_2,v]=C_2[b_2,v]$ or $C_W[v, a_4]$ has length at least $k$.
Indeed, if $q=p+1$, then it follows from the fact that $B_2$ has length as least $7k$; if
$5\leq q\leq p$, then it comes form the fact that $B_4$ is a subdipath of $C_W[v, a_r]$; if $q=4$, then it follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:dis}  applied to $C_3$, $C_2$, $C_4$ in the role of $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$ respectively.
In both case, $C_W[b_2, a_4]$ has length at least $k$. 

Furthermore, $C_W[a_4,b_2]$ has length at least $k$ because it contains $B_3$. Therefore the union of
$C_W[b_2, a_4]$, $C_W[a_4,b_2]$ and $C'[b_2,a_4]=C_3[b_3,a_4]$ is a subdivision of of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.
\end{subproof}




\begin{lemma}\label{lem:IC}
Let ${\cal C}$ be a suitable collection of directed cycles in a $P(k,1;k)$-\free\ digraph.

Let $c$ be a partial colouring of a cycle $C_1\in {\cal C}$ such that only a path of length at most
$9k$ is coloured and this path is rainbow-coloured. Then $c$ can be extended into
a colouring of $C_1\cup I(C_1)$ using $2\cdot \col + 18k$ colours, such that every subpath of length at most $9k$ of $C_1$ is rainbow-coloured and  $Q_j$ is rainbow-coloured, for every $C_j\in {\cal C}\cap C_1$.\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We can easily extend $c$ to $C_1$ using $18k$ colours (including the at most $9k$ already used colours)
so that every subpath of $C_1$ of length $9k$ is rainbow-coloured.

We shall now prove that there exists a colouring $c^+$ of $I^+(C_1)$ with $\col$ (new) colours so that $Q^+_j$ is rainbow-coloured for every $C_j\in {\cal C}\cap C_1$, and a colouring $c^-$ of $I^-(C_1)$ with $\col$ (other new) colours so that $Q^-_j$ is rainbow-coloured for every $C_j\in {\cal C}\cap C_1$.
The union of these three colourings is clearly the desired colouring of $C_1\cup \bigcup{\cal C}[I(C_1)]$. (Observe that a vertex of $I(C_1)$ is coloured only once because  $I^+(C_1)$ and $I^-(C_1)$ are disjoint.)

It remains to prove the existence of $c^+$ and $c^-$. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the existence of $c^+$.
 To prove the existence of $c^+$ we consider an auxilary digraph $D^+_1$.
 For each $C_j\in {\cal C}\cap C_1$, let $T^+_j$ be the transitive tournament whose hamiltonian dipath is $Q^+_j$.
Let $D^+_1=\bigcup_{C_j\in  {\cal C}\cap C_1} T^+_j$. 
The arcs of the $A(T^+_j)\setminus A(Q^+_j$ are called {\it fake arcs}.
%Observe that $D^+_1$ is acyclic because $I^+(C_1)$ is. Indeed, if there were a directed cycle
%cycle in $D^+_1$, it could be transformed into a closed directed walk (by replacing each arc $(u,v)\in A(T^+_j)$, by 
%$Q^+_j[u,v]$), which would contain a directed cycle.
Clearly, $c^+$ exists if and only if $D^+_1$ admits a proper colouring. Henceforth it remains to prove the following claim.

\begin{claim}
$\chi(D^+_1) \leq  \col$.
\end{claim}

\begin{subproof}
To each vertex $v$ in $I^+(C_1)$ we associate the set $\Dis(v)$ of the lengths of the $C_j[t_{1,j},v]$ for all cycle $C_j\in {\cal C} \cap C_1$ containing $v$ such that $C_j[t_{1,j},v]$ has length at most $4k$.


Suppose for a contradiction that $\chi(D^+_1) \leq  \col$.
By Gallai-Roy Theorem, $D^+_1$ admits a directed path of length $\col$. Replacing all fake arcs  $(u,v)$ in some $A(T^+_j)$, by 
$Q^+_j[u,v]$ we obtain a directed walk $P$ in $I^+(C_1)$ of length at least $\col$. By Lemma \ref{lem:no-dicycle}, $P$ is necessarily a directed path. Set $P=(v_1,  \dots , v_{p})$. We have $p\geq \col$.

For $1\leq i\leq p$, let $m_i = \min \Dis(v_i)$. 
Lemma \ref{min} applied to $(m_i)_{1\leq i\leq p}$ yields  a set of $8k^2$ indices of such that 
for any $i< j \in L$,  $m_i=m_j$ and $m_k > m_i$, for all $i< k < j$.
Let $l_1 < l_2 < \cdots < l_{8k^2}$ be the elements of $L$ and let $m= m_{l_1} = \cdots = m_{l_{8k^2}}$.


For $1\leq j\leq 8k^2-1$, let $M_j = \max \bigcup_{l_j\leq i < l_{j+1}} \Dis(v_i)$.
By definition $M_j\leq 4k$.
Applying Lemma~\ref{max} to $(M_j)_{1\leq j\leq 8k^2}$,  we get a sequence of size $2k$ $M_{j_0+1} \dots M_{j_0+{2k}}$ such that $M_{j_0+{2k}}$ is the greatest. For sake of simplicity, we set $\ell_i =j_0+i$ for $1\leq i\leq 2k$.
Let $f$ the smallest index not smaller than $\ell_{2k}$ for which $M_{\ell_{2k}} \in \Dis (v_f)$. 

Let $j_1$ be an index such that $C_{j_1}[t_{1,j_1},v_{\ell_1}]$ has length $m$ and set $P_1=C_{j_1}[t_{1,j_1},v_{\ell_1}]$.
Let $j_2$ be an index such that $C_{j_2}[t_{1,j_2},v_{\ell_k}]$ has length $m$ and set $P_2=C_{j_2}[t_{1,j_2},v_{\ell_k}]$.
Let $j_3$ be an index such that  $C_{j_3}[t_{1,j_3},v_{f}]$ has length $M_{\ell_{2k}}$ and set $P_3=C_{j_3}[v_f, s_{1,j_3}]$ (some vertices of $P_3$ are not in $I^+(C_1)$).

Note that any internal vertex $x$ of $P_1$ or $P_2$ has an integer in $\Dis(x)$
which is smaller than $m$ and every internal vertex $y$ of $P_3$ has an integer in $\Dis(y)$ which
is greater than $M_{\ell_{2k}}$, or does not belong to $I^+(C_1)$. Hence, 
$P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ are disjoint from $P[v_{\ell_1},v_f]$. 


We distinguishes between the intersection of $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Suppose $P_3$ does not intersect $P_1 \cup P_2$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Assume first that $P_1$ and $P_2$ are disjoint. If $s(P_1)$ is in $C_1[t(P_3), s(P_2)]$, then the union of  $P_1 \odot P[v_{\ell_1}, v_{\ell_k}]$, $P[v_{\ell_k}, v_f] \odot P_3\odot C_1[t(P_3), s(P_1)]$ and $C_1[s(P_1), s(P_2)]\odot P_2$ is a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.
		 If $s(P_1)$ is in $C_1[ s(P_2), t(P_3)]$, then the union of  $C_1[s(P_2), s(P_1)]\odot P_1\odot P[v_{\ell_1}, v_{\ell_k}]$, $P[v_{\ell_k}, v_f]\odot  P_3\odot C_1[t(P_3), s(P_2)]$, and  $P_2$ is a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.
	
		\item Assume now $P_1$ and $P_2$ intersect. Let $u$ be the last vertex along $P_2$ on which they intersect. The union of $P_1[u,v_{\ell_1}]\odot P[v_{\ell_1}, v_{\ell_k}]$, $P[v_{\ell_k}, v_f]\odot P_3\odot C[t(P_3), s(P_1)]\odot P_1[s(P_1), u]$, and $P_2[u, v_{\ell_k}]$ is a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.
	\end{itemize}

	\item Assume $P_3$ intersect $P_1\cap P_2$. Let $v$ be the first vertex along $P_3$ in $P_1\cap P_2$ and let $u$ be the last vertex of $P_1\cap P_2$ along $P_2$. The union of $P_1[u,v_{\ell_1}]\odot P[v_{\ell_1}, v_{\ell_k}]$, $P[v_{\ell_k}, v_f]\odot P_3[v_f,v]\odot P_1[v, u]$, and $P_2[u, v_{\ell_k}]$ is a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.

	\item Assume now that $P_3$ intersect $P_1\cup P_2$ but not $P_1\cap P_2$. Let $v$ be the first vertex along $P_3$ in $P_1\cup P_2$.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If $v \in P_2$, let $u$ be the last vertex on $P_2\cap P_3$ along $P_3$. Observe that $P_3[v,u]$ is also a subpath of $P_2$ and therefore contains no vertex of $P_1$. Furthermore, there is a dipath $Q$ from $u$ to $v_{\ell_1}$ in $P_3[u, t(P_3)]\cup C_1\cup  P_1$. Hence, the union of $P[v_{\ell_k}, v_f] \odot P_3[v_f,v]$, $Q\odot P[v_{\ell_1},v_{\ell_k}]$, and $P_2[u,v_{\ell_k}$ is a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.

	The union of $P[v_{\ell_k}, v_f] \odot P_3[v_f,u]$, $P_1[u, v_{\ell_1}]\odot P[v_{\ell_1}, v_{\ell_k}]$ and $Q$ is a subdivision of $P(k,1;k)$, a contradiction.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:col-union-cycle}
Let ${\cal C}$ be a suitable collection of directed cycles in a $P(k,1;k)$-\free\ digraph.
There exists a proper colouring $c$ of $\bigcup{\cal C}$ with $2\cdot \col + 18k$ colours, such that, each subpath of length $9k$ of each cycle of $\mathcal{C}$ is rainbow-coloured.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We prove by induction on the number of cycles in $\mathcal{C}$ the following stronger statement:
{\it if there exists
a partial colouring $c$ such that one of the cycle $C_1$ has a path of length less than $9k$
which is rainbow-coloured, then we can extend this colouring to all $D[\mathcal{C}]$ using less
than $2\col +18k$ colours such that, on each cycle, every subpath of length
$9k$ is rainbow-coloured}.

Consider a rainbow-colouring of a subpath of length less than $9k$ of a cycle $C_1\in {\cal C}$.
By Lemma \ref{lem:IC}, we can extend this colouring to a colouring $c_1$ of $I(C_1)$ at most $2\cdot \col + 18k$ colours.
Note that the non-coloured vertices of $\bigcup{\cal C}$ are in one of the connected components of $\bigcup{\cal C} - I(C_1)$.
Let $A$ be a connected component of $\bigcup{\cal C} - I(C_1)$. The coloured (by $c_1$) vertices of ${\cal C}\cap A$ are those of $({\cal C}\cap A)-A$. Hence, by Lemma \ref{lem:A}, they all belong to some cycle $C_j$ and so to the diptah $Q_j$ which has length at most $9k$.
Hence, by the induction hypothesis, we can extend $c_1$ to $A$. Doing this for each component, we extend $c_1$ to the whole $\bigcup{\cal C}$.
\end{proof}

Let ${\cal C}$ be a suitable collection of directed cycles in a $P(k,1;k)$-\free\ digraph $D$.
Then $\chi(D[\mathcal{C}]) < ? $
